It is a player vs computer game, who goes first is randomly selected.

Three players (Tipsy, Genghis, Boris) use simple rules I created to drive the player.

Sima Yi uses the Minimax algorithm I adapted from a game site, he is unbeatable.

You select a player by clicking on the button with their name, located below the board.

**Note**: If you play against Sima Yi there may be a one slight delay betwen moves.

There is a console application included in the solution which randomly pits computer 
players against each other. 

It displays running statistics and continues until the user hits x.

Both Sima Yi and Boris are unbeaten:

The results are fairly consistant over many runs.

This was a fun challenge to start learning about Blazor WebAssembly.
