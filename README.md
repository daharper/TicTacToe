# TicTacToe

This was my first exploration of WebAssembly.

Simple game to explore and experiment with Blazor WebAssembly.

It is a player vs computer game, who goes first is randomly selected.

Three players (Tipsy, Genghis, Boris) use simple rules created to drive the player.

Sima Yi uses the Minimax algorithm I adapted from a game site, he is unbeatable.

You select a player by clicking on the button with their name, located below the board.

**Note**: If you play against Sima Yi there may be a slight delay betwen moves.

There is a computer vs compulter console application included in the solution.

It displays running statistics and continues until the user hits x.

Both Sima Yi and Boris are unbeaten:

The results are fairly consistant over many runs.

This was a fun challenge to start learning about Blazor WebAssembly.
